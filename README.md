# JavaScript-Practice
- This is what I practice while learning JavaScript.
- All thanks to Free Code Camp for guiding me through these projects on Youtube.
- In these projects I have focused only on practicing JavaScript, CSS is already given by Free Code Camp.
- Gradually improving my JavaScript skills.
